<b><u>Abstract:</u> </b>
Deep learning is one of the advance machine learning tool that have shown
promising results in the domains of classification and prediction. One of the expanding
area which require good prediction accuracy is sports prediction. Team managers and
coaches are striving for machine learning models so that they can understand and formulate
strategies needed to win matches. In addition, betting websites are interested in
models which can increase their profits margins. These models are based on numerous
factors involved in the games, such as result of historical matches, box score statistics,
and opposition information. This project provides an analysis of the literature in Machine
learning for sports prediction, focusing on the application of Artificial Neural Network
(ANN) along with other machine learning algorithms and their implementation on sport
result prediction. In doing so, we identify the learning methodologies, dataset utilised,
appropriate means of model evaluation, and specific challenges of predicting sport results.
This then leads us to propose a sport prediction framework through which deep
learning can be used as a learning strategy. This research will hopefully be informative
and of use to those performing future research in this application area.

<b><u>Conclusion:</u></b>
In this work, I proposed a Neural network approach along logistic Regression model to predict the winner of a NBA game. It is discovered that if we use Box score stats for the same we need to remodel the data with average of last few games played by both the teams as directly using the box score stats may give high accuracy model but the model will not be able to forecast future predictions. After remodelling the data as average data from previous 5 games we got an accuracy of approximately 60% on both the models which is not so good as prediction so we tried increasing the accuracy with the help of other machine learning optimization techniques and we reached a mark slightly more than 66% with Logistic regression model. This was the highest accuracy attained by our model but betting website analysts have maximum accuracy of around 68% which is higher that our model. Basketball is a game where there are so many variable in action along with the teams playing on court, players injury, their contract negotiation and management changes which can affect the team performance and its not only these factors, there are unlimited number of such factors. I believe there is still so much room of improvement in the model but it can only be possible if we can somehow include all these unpredictable constrains as a feature in basketball game statistics and record those variables in terms of some mathematical value so we can use those to create a machine learning model which can give a much better accuracy. Betting experts are very well trained professional and they are familiar with every activity going on in the NBA and they can use those stats for prediction in real time. I believe that there are multiple ongoing researches happening in this field and researchers are going to figure out ways to achieve way better accuracies in term of sports prediction than current stat of art models, it’s just matter of time. For my project, to the best of my knowledge, I gained a maximum accuracy which is around 66.3% and it is not so bad with respect to time provided for designing the project.
